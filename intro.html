                <p>Hi! I am Ashutosh Singh, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web 
                    Designing and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but

                A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. <br>
                    The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET, Python,
                    Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. <br>
                You’re the person who your friends go to when they want someone to build their “billion-dollar business
