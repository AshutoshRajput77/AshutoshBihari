                    <p class="text">blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is a discussion or informational website
                        published on the
                        World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts
                        are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears
                        first, at the top of the web page. <span class="dots">....</span> <span class="moreText">Until
                            2009, blogs were usually the work of a single
                            individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single
                            subject
                            or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of
                            multiple
                            authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets,
                            universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an
                            increasing
                            quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps
                            integrate
                            MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning
                            to
                            maintain or add content to a blog.</span></p>

                    <p>There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in
                        the way that content is delivered or written.</p>
                    <h2>Personal blogs</h2>
                    <p class="text">The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual,
                        rather than
                        a corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few
                        readers, other than the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs
                        have become popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship.
